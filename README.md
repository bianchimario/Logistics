Project: Health Care Provider of Florida Problem

Health Care Provider of Florida (HCPF) is planning to build a number of new emergency-care clinics in central Florida. HCPF management has divided a map of the area into seven regions. They want to locate the emergency centers so that all seven regions will be conveniently served by at least one facility. Five candidate sites are available for constructing the new facilities. The regions that can be served conveniently by each site are indicated by X below:

1. Formulate an ILP model to determine which sites should be selected so as to provide convenient service to all locations in the least costly manner.
2. Implement the model via the modelling language AMPL and solve it by means of the optimization solver CPLEX.
3. Assume that a budget of $1000 is available to HCPF for constructing the new facilities. Modify the model, and solve it by means of AMPL and CPLEX, in order to determine where to construct the facilities so as to maximize the number of the regions which will be served conveniently.
4. Modify the model in 3 with the following additional constraint: if a facility is constructed in Sanford, then a facility must necessarily be constructed also in Casselberry. Solve the proposed model by means of AMPL and CPLEX, and compare the optimal solution found with the ones determined at points 2 and 3.
